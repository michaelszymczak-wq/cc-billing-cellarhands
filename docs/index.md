## Overview

The Cellar-Hands Billing Portal connects to your InnoVint cellar management system and automates the billing process for winery services. It pulls action data from InnoVint, matches each action to your configured rate rules, and produces detailed billing reports and invoices.

### What the portal handles

- **Action-based billing** - Filters, analyses, additions, custom labor, bottling, barrel operations, and more
- **Inventory-based billing** - Bulk wine storage (per gallon) and empty barrel/tirage storage (per barrel)
- **Fruit intake contracts** - Multi-month installment billing for fruit processing
- **Billable add-ons** - Manual one-off charges
- **Invoice generation** - Professional PDF invoices per customer
- **Excel exports** - Multi-sheet workbooks with full billing detail
